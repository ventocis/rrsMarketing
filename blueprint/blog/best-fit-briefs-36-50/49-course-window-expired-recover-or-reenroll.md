# My BDI/BDIC course window expired—how do I recover or re‑enroll?

**Short answer:** If you **miss Florida’s BDI deadlines** (election or completion/submission), the clerk may **assess points** and additional penalties. In **Michigan**, **no extensions** are granted for the **60‑day BDIC window**; points and insurer visibility may apply. Contact the **clerk (FL)** or **SOS (MI)** to understand your status. Your provider can help with **re‑enrollment**, but **government deadlines** control outcomes.

## What to do next
- **Florida:** Contact your **county clerk** for next steps and compliance.
- **Michigan:** Review the **BDIC FAQ** and consult SOS if needed.
- **Ask your provider** about re‑enrollment options for future courses.
