# Who is eligible for Michigan BDIC (SOS letter explained)?

**Short answer:** The SOS **contacts eligible drivers**. To qualify, you generally need a **valid Michigan non‑commercial license**, a **ticket issued in Michigan**, and an **eligible (non‑criminal) violation**; you **weren’t driving a CMV**, and you didn’t have more than **two points** at the time of the ticket. If you meet the criteria, your letter/email will give you **60 days** to **enroll and pass** BDIC with an **approved sponsor**.

## What to do next
- **Read your SOS notice carefully** for your exact 60‑day window.
- **Enroll** with an approved sponsor and plan to finish early.
- **Contact SOS** if you believe you’re eligible but didn’t receive notice.
