# Can insurers see my ticket if I pass Michigan BDIC?

**Short answer:** If you’re **eligible** and **pass within 60 days**, SOS **will not make the ticket information available to insurance companies**, and **points aren’t added** for that ticket. You still must resolve any court fines/fees.

## What to do next
- **Finish BDIC** before your 60‑day deadline.
- **Verify** your record later if you want reassurance.
- **Keep documentation** from your course provider for your files.
