# Best Florida BDI for busy parents who need evening study

**Short answer:** Pick an **FLHSMV‑approved** BDI that’s **self‑paced** and **mobile‑friendly** so you can study after bedtime. Elect with your **clerk within 30 days**, then plan short evening sessions and **submit/verify** your certificate before the county deadline (**often 60–90 days** from the citation).

## What to do next
- **Elect BDI** with your **county clerk** within **30 days**.
- **Choose an approved** online course with solid progress saving.
- **Finish early** and follow your county’s **certificate submission** steps.
