# Michigan BDIC certificate: do I submit anything or is it auto‑reported?

**Short answer:** **Approved sponsors handle reporting** of your **BDIC pass** to the **Michigan Department of State**. You don’t submit a certificate to SOS, but you should **save your receipt/confirmation** for your files in case you ever need to verify.

## What to do next
- **Finish BDIC** with an approved sponsor within **60 days**.
- **Save** your completion confirmation/receipt.
- **Check** your record later if you want added reassurance.
