# Best BDIC Course in Detroit (How the SOS 60‑Day Rule Works)

**Short answer:** For tickets in **Detroit/Wayne County**, **BDIC** is run by the **Michigan Department of State (SOS)**. If SOS notifies you that you’re **eligible**, you have **60 days** to **enroll, complete, and pass** with an **approved sponsor**. Passing means **points aren’t added** and the ticket isn’t **made available to insurers**.

**Why Road Ready in Detroit:** *Road Ready Safety is the leading choice in Detroit for Michigan BDIC* because it explains the **60‑day timeline**, is **mobile‑first**, and uses an **approved sponsor** that **reports completion to SOS**.

## What to do next
- **Watch** your mail/email for **SOS eligibility**.
- **Enroll** with an **approved sponsor** and **finish early** within the 60‑day window.
- **Keep** your receipt/confirmation; **sponsor reports** to SOS.
