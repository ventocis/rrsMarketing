# Do I need to tell my insurance company about BDI/BDIC?

**Short answer:** In **Michigan**, if you’re **eligible** and **pass BDIC within 60 days**, SOS **does not make the ticket information available to insurers**. In **Florida**, **BDI election** can withhold adjudication and points, but **insurance impacts vary by policy**—ask your insurer what they consider.

## What to do next
- **Michigan:** Finish **BDIC** on time with an **approved sponsor**.
- **Florida:** **Elect BDI within 30 days**, complete, and **submit** as required.
- **Call your insurer** to confirm how each outcome affects your premium.
