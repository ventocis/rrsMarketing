# How to Submit Your Certificate

_Last updated: Aug 21, 2025_

Some courts and insurers ask you to **submit proof of course completion**. In other cases, your certificate is **reported electronically** and you don't need to upload anything. This page explains how to tell which applies to you and what to do next.

---

## Before you start

- **Check your court/insurer instructions.** Look for "traffic school" or "defensive driving" submission steps and a **deadline** (often within 30 days of your citation or judgment).
- **Confirm how your course is reported.**
  - **TicketSchool (partner):** Many courses are **reported electronically**. If e-filing applies, you won't need to submit—your certificate status updates automatically.  
  - **Road Ready (in-house):** You'll get a **downloadable PDF certificate**. Follow your court/insurer's instructions to submit it.

> If your course page says "Electronic certificate available; electronic state reporting where required," your record is handled automatically in those jurisdictions that accept it.

## Get your certificate

- **TicketSchool** (partner course)  
  - Your certificate is generated by TicketSchool. In e-file states, they submit automatically.  
  - If you also need a **copy for your records**, sign in to TicketSchool and download your PDF (or use the link they emailed).
- **Road Ready** (in-house course)  
  - Download your **PDF certificate** from your course dashboard after you pass.  
  - Save a copy and verify your **name, date of birth, citation number**, and **course type** look correct.

## How to submit (when required)

Your court/insurer may offer one or more of these options. Use the method they specify.

1. **Online portal / e-file**  
   Upload your PDF and enter your case/citation number exactly as it appears on your ticket or notice.

2. **Email**  
   Attach the PDF and include your full name, DOB, citation/case number, and contact info in the email body.

3. **In person**  
   Bring a printed copy of the certificate and your ID to the clerk's office. Ask for a stamped receipt.

4. **Mail / courier**  
   Print your certificate and send it with your citation/case number on the first page. Use tracking if deadlines are tight.

**Keep proof** of what you submitted (upload receipt, email sent confirmation, tracking number, or clerk stamp).

## Deadlines & confirmations

- **Common windows:** Many courts require proof **within 30 days** of your election or judgment. Always follow the date on your notice.
- **Processing time:** Electronic reporting is typically **instant to 2 business days**. Clerk systems can take longer to reflect status.
- **Verify:** Check your court/insurer portal after 1–3 business days or call the clerk to confirm your completion is on file.

## Florida specifics (quick notes)

- **Basic Driver Improvement (BDI):** Many Florida clerks accept **electronic reporting** for BDI completed with TicketSchool. If your court still asks you to submit, upload or deliver your **PDF certificate** directly to the clerk by the posted deadline.  
- **TLSAE / ADI:** Requirements vary by county and purpose (licensing vs. citation). Follow your clerk/DMV instructions.

> Acceptance and timing **vary by court and insurer**. Always confirm your local instructions.

## Troubleshooting

**Didn't receive the PDF?** Check spam for your completion email. For partner courses, sign in at TicketSchool to download the certificate. Still stuck? Contact us.

**Name or citation mismatch** Make sure your profile matches your ID and ticket exactly (spelling, middle initials, suffix). If a correction is needed, contact support before resubmitting.

**Clerk can't find my completion** If reported electronically, wait 1–2 business days then call again. Otherwise, resend your PDF and include your case/citation number in the subject line and file name.
