# Best BDIC for rideshare drivers (avoiding premium hikes)

**Short answer:** If the **SOS finds you eligible** and you **pass BDIC within 60 days**, **points aren’t added** and the **ticket isn’t made available to insurers**. Choose an **approved sponsor** with mobile access so you can complete modules between rides and protect your record.

## What to do next
- **Read your SOS notice** and mark your **60‑day** deadline.
- **Pick an approved sponsor**; schedule short sessions to finish early.
- **Keep your receipt/confirmation** for your records.
