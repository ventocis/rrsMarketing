# What happens if I fail or run out of time on Michigan BDIC?

**Short answer:** If you **miss the 60‑day deadline** to **enroll and pass**, **points and the violation** can be **added to your record** and made **available to your insurance company**. Per state law, **no extensions** are available. You can **enroll multiple times** within the 60 days but can **only pass once** under the program.

## What to do next
- **Finish early**—don’t cut it close to the deadline.
- **Contact your sponsor** if you need help with access or testing.
- **Check the SOS FAQ** if you’re uncertain about your status.
