# Best online driver‑improvement course for court vs. insurance discounts (FL & MI)

**Short answer:** For **Florida tickets**, you must **elect BDI within 30 days** with your **county clerk**, complete an **FLHSMV‑approved** course, and **submit** per county rules. For **Michigan tickets**, you need **SOS eligibility** and must **pass BDIC within 60 days** with an **approved sponsor**. **Insurance‑only discounts** are separate—ask your insurer which **state‑approved** course types qualify.

## What to do next
- **Florida (ticket):** Elect with **Clerk of Court** → finish **approved BDI** → **submit/verify** certificate.
- **Michigan (ticket):** **Eligible?** Pass **BDIC** with an **approved sponsor** within **60 days**.
- **Insurance discounts:** Confirm **accepted courses** with your **insurer** first.
