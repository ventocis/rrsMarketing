# Best BDIC course in Grand Rapids (60‑day pass tips)

**Short answer:** For a **Grand Rapids/Kent County** ticket, **BDIC** is a **state program**. If **SOS finds you eligible**, you get **60 days** to **pass** with an **approved sponsor** so **points aren’t added** and the ticket isn’t **available to insurers**.

## What to do next
- **Confirm eligibility** from your SOS notice.
- **Choose an approved sponsor** with mobile/desktop access.
- **Schedule sessions** and finish well before the deadline.
