# BDI/BDIC pricing: what should I expect to pay and what’s included?

**Short answer:** **Course prices** are set by **private providers/sponsors**; **state agencies** define program rules but don’t set provider fees. In **Florida**, **court costs/fines** are separate from your **BDI course fee**. In **Michigan**, you pay your **BDIC sponsor** and still owe any **court fines/fees** related to the ticket.

## What to do next
- **Check provider pricing** pages for full cost and any add‑ons.
- **Budget separately** for **court/citation** obligations.
- Choose providers with **clear refund/support** policies.
