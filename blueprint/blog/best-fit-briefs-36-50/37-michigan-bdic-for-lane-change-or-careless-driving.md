# Michigan BDIC for lane‑change or careless driving—will it block points?

**Short answer:** If the **Michigan Department of State** (SOS) **notifies you that you’re eligible**, and you **pass BDIC within 60 days**, **points aren’t added** for that ticket and the violation **isn’t made available to insurers**. Eligibility is determined by SOS and may exclude some violations.

## What to do next
- **Read your SOS notice** to confirm **eligibility** and **deadline**.
- **Enroll with an approved sponsor** and plan to finish early.
- **Keep your receipt**; you may check your record later for reassurance.
