# What violations qualify for Michigan BDIC (and which don’t)?

**Short answer:** The SOS determines eligibility. Generally, you need a **valid Michigan non‑commercial license** and a **ticket issued in Michigan** for an **eligible (non‑criminal) moving violation**. **CDL holders**, **CMV citations**, **criminal offenses**, **non‑Michigan tickets**, or having **more than two points** at the time may disqualify you.

## What to do next
- **Check the SOS eligibility page** and your **notice** for specifics.
- If eligible, **enroll** and **pass within 60 days** with an approved sponsor.
- **Keep copies** of your completion for your records.
