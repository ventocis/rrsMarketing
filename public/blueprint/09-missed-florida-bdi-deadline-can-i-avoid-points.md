# What if I miss the Florida BDI deadline—can I still avoid points?

**Short answer:** If you **don’t elect within 30 days** or **don’t complete/submit on time**, you can **lose the BDI option** and **points may be assessed**. Outcomes depend on county rules and your case status. Check with your **Clerk of Court** immediately and review your record/BDI status using state tools.

## What to do next
- **Contact the issuing county clerk** to ask about your options.
- **Check your status** via FLHSMV’s Traffic School Completion Check.
- Consider speaking with an attorney for legal advice about your case.
