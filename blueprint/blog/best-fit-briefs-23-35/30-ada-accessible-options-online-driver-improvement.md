# Are there ADA/accessible options for online driver improvement?

**Short answer:** Many **state‑approved** courses provide **accessibility features** (e.g., screen‑reader support, captions, keyboard navigation). Check the provider’s **accessibility statement** and contact **support** for accommodations. Public ADA resources explain your rights and common aids for online services.

## What to do next
- Choose **state‑approved** BDI/BDIC providers that list **accessibility features**.
- **Ask support** for available accommodations before you purchase.
- Review ADA resources for general rights and guidance.
