# Best BDIC course in Detroit (how the SOS timeline works)

**Short answer:** For a ticket in **Detroit/Wayne County**, **BDIC** is handled by the **Michigan Department of State**. If **SOS notifies you that you’re eligible**, you have **60 days** to **enroll, complete, and pass** with an **approved sponsor**—then **points aren’t added** and the ticket isn’t **available to insurers**.

## What to do next
- **Watch your mail/email** for **SOS eligibility**.
- **Pick an approved sponsor** and plan short study sessions.
- **Finish early** and keep your completion confirmation.
