# Michigan BDIC timing: when does the 60‑day clock start?

**Short answer:** Your **60‑day** BDIC window starts when the **Michigan Department of State notifies you** that you’re eligible. There are **no extensions** if you miss the deadline—points and ticket details may then appear on your record and be visible to insurers.

## What to do next
- **Mark your deadline** from the **notice date** (email/letter).
- **Schedule study time** and finish early to avoid last‑minute issues.
- **Keep proof** of enrollment and completion for your records.
