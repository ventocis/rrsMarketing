# Can a course remove points vs. just prevent points (FL & MI)?

**Short answer:** **Florida BDI** (when **elected within 30 days** for an eligible violation) can lead to **adjudication withheld** and **no points added**. **Michigan BDIC** (when **eligible** and **passed within 60 days**) means **points aren’t added** and the ticket isn’t made **available to insurers**. Already‑assessed points are generally **not removed** retroactively.

## What to do next
- **Florida:** Elect **BDI** with the **clerk** and complete/submit on time.
- **Michigan:** If **eligible**, **pass BDIC** within **60 days**.
- **Verify** your record with the state if you need confirmation.
