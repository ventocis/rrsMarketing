# What’s the best Florida BDI course for a speeding ticket?

**Short answer:** If you received a *non‑criminal moving violation* in Florida and you don’t hold a CDL, you can **elect a Basic Driver Improvement (BDI) course within 30 days** to keep points off your record (adjudication withheld). Elect with the **county Clerk of Court**, finish your approved online course, and **follow your clerk’s submission instructions**.

## What to do next
- **Elect BDI within 30 days** of the citation **with the clerk** where you were cited.
- **Complete an FLHSMV‑approved** online BDI course.
- **Submit/verify completion** per your county clerk’s rules; keep proof for your records.
