# Out‑of‑state driver with a Michigan ticket—can I take BDIC?

**Short answer:** **Probably not.** The SOS notes BDIC eligibility includes having a **valid Michigan (non‑commercial) driver’s license**, and the **ticket must be issued in Michigan**. If you **don’t have a Michigan license**, BDIC generally doesn’t apply—follow the **court/citation instructions** for your situation.

## What to do next
- **Review** the SOS eligibility criteria.
- **Contact the court** listed on your citation for options.
- Consider seeking **legal advice** for your specific case.
