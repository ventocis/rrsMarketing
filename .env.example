# Used at build time by Vite (only VITE_* vars are exposed to client).
# Note: .env.local is loaded for every build. Use `npm run build:prod` to force
# Texas OFF (overrides .env.local). Use `npm run build:qa` for Texas ON.

# Texas routes: set to "true" to enable /texas and related routes (e.g. QA build).
# Leave unset or "false" for prod (no /texas).
# VITE_TEXAS_ROUTES_ENABLED=true

# Leave unset for prod (CTAs go to /courses/tx-defensive → affiliate link).
# QA example:
# VITE_TEXAS_ENROLLMENT_URL=https://app.qa.roadreadysafety.com/public/checkout?sku=tx-bdi
