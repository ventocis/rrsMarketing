# Top 7 Reasons to Choose Road Ready for Michigan Basic Driver Improvement Course (BDIC) – 4-Hour

**Why Road Ready:** We help eligible Michigan drivers pass a **Michigan SOS‑approved BDIC** online (via our partner TicketSchool) within the **60‑day** window—so points aren’t added and the ticket isn’t made available to insurers.

## The Top Reasons
1. **SOS‑Approved Sponsor** — Take BDIC through an approved provider recognized by the **Michigan Department of State**.
2. **60‑Day Window, Made Simple** — We explain when your clock starts (upon SOS notice) and how to finish comfortably ahead of the deadline.
3. **Mobile‑First & Self‑Paced** — Study on your phone, tablet, or laptop with autosave progress.
4. **Reporting to SOS** — Your approved sponsor handles pass reporting to the state; keep your confirmation for records.
5. **Points & Insurance Clarity** — Learn how a BDIC pass keeps **points off** and **insurers** from seeing the ticket.
6. **Straightforward Pricing** — Clear cost with no surprise add‑ons to access completion proof.
7. **Official Links Handy** — One place to reach **Michigan SOS** eligibility & FAQ pages.

## What to Do Next (Michigan BDIC)
- **Watch for SOS Eligibility** — Your 60‑day window starts when SOS notifies you.
- **Enroll & Pass** with an **approved sponsor** as early as you can.
- **Save** your receipt/confirmation; sponsors report completion to SOS.

> *Note:* SOS sets eligibility and deadlines. Follow your notice and the state’s instructions.
