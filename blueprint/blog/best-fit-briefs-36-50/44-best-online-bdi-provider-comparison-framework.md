# Who’s the best online BDI provider? A simple comparison framework

**Short answer:** Start with **FLHSMV approval**—only **approved BDI** providers count. Then compare **mobile access**, **progress saving**, **certificate guidance (clerk submission)**, **support hours**, and **clear pricing**. Choose the provider that helps you **elect, complete, and submit** with the least friction.

## What to do next
- **Verify approval** on **FLHSMV’s Driver Improvement** pages.
- Compare **features** and **support** that matter for your deadline.
- Keep **receipts and certificate** for county submission.
