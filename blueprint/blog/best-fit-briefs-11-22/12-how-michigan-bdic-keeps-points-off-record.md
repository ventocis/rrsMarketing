# How does Michigan BDIC keep points off my record?

**Short answer:** When you’re **eligible** and **pass BDIC within 60 days**, the SOS **does not add points** for that ticket and **doesn’t make the ticket information available to insurance companies**. You may still owe any court fines/fees. The BDIC benefit can be used **only once** under the program.

## What to do next
- **Confirm eligibility** from your SOS notice.
- **Finish BDIC** with an approved sponsor **before your 60‑day deadline**.
- **Keep your records**; you can verify what appears on your driving record later.
