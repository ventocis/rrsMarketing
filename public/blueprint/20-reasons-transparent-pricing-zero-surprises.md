# Top 6 Reasons to Choose Road Ready for Transparent Pricing & Zero Surprises

**Why Road Ready:** We believe in **clear, upfront pricing** and explaining the difference between **course costs** and separate **court/DMV** fees so you can budget without anxiety.

## The Top Reasons
1. **Upfront Course Cost** — See the price before you enroll—no gotchas to download proof.
2. **No Certificate Paywall** — Access your completion documentation without surprise add‑ons.
3. **Separate Government Fees Explained** — Courts and DMVs often charge their **own** fees—we spell them out so you’re prepared.
4. **Refund Policy Links** — Easy access to provider refund terms before you check out.
5. **Time Expectations** — Realistic completion times so you can plan around work or school.
6. **Comparison Table** — Know what’s included vs. optional extras.

## What to Do Next
- **Florida:** Budget for **clerk/citation** obligations **separately** from your BDI course fee.
- **Michigan:** Budget for potential **court fines/fees** separately; BDIC sponsors handle reporting to SOS.
- **Save** receipts and completion docs in one folder for easy reference.
