# Florida BDI deadlines: do I get 60 or 90 days to finish?

**Short answer:** **Completion deadlines are set by your county Clerk of Court.** Many counties allow **60–90 days** (often counted from the citation date) to **finish BDI and handle certificate steps**. Always check your county’s page for the exact due date and submission method.

## What to do next
- **Confirm your deadline** on your **county clerk** website.
- **Finish the course early** to avoid last‑minute issues.
- **Submit/verify** your completion with the clerk as instructed.
