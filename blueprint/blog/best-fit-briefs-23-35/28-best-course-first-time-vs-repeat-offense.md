# Best online course for first‑time ticket vs. repeat offenses

**Short answer:** **Florida BDI** can be elected **once every 12 months** and a limited number of **lifetime elections** apply—check current FLHSMV guidance. **Michigan BDIC** is a **one‑time** program benefit when you’re **eligible** and **pass within 60 days**. If you have multiple recent tickets, confirm you still **qualify** before enrolling.

## What to do next
- **Florida:** Confirm **frequency limits** and **elect** within **30 days** if eligible.
- **Michigan:** If **SOS‑eligible**, **pass BDIC** within **60 days** (one time).
- If unsure, **contact the clerk/SOS** or seek legal advice about your case.
