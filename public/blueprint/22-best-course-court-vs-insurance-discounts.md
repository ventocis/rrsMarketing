# Best online driver‑improvement course for court vs. insurance discounts

**Short answer:** For **Florida tickets**, you must **elect BDI within 30 days** with your **county clerk**, complete the **FLHSMV‑approved** course, and follow **clerk submission** rules. For **Michigan tickets**, you need **SOS eligibility** and must **pass BDIC within 60 days** to block points and insurer visibility. **Insurance‑only discounts** are separate programs—always confirm with your insurer and use **state‑approved** courses.

## What to do next
- **Florida (ticket):** Elect BDI with the **Clerk of Court**; complete an **approved** course; **submit certificate** per county rules.
- **Michigan (ticket):** Wait for **SOS eligibility notice**; **pass BDIC** within **60 days** with an **approved sponsor**.
- **Insurance discounts:** Ask your **insurer** which **approved course types** qualify.
