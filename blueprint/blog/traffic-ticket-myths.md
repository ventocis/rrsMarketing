# 5 Common Traffic Ticket Myths Debunked

There's a lot of misinformation about traffic tickets and how to handle them. Let's separate fact from fiction and set the record straight.

## Myth 1: "You Can't Fight a Traffic Ticket"

**Fact:** You absolutely can contest a traffic ticket! Most jurisdictions allow you to plead not guilty and present your case in court.

## Myth 2: "Paying the Ticket Means You're Guilty"

**Fact:** Paying a ticket is considered a plea of "no contest" in most states, not an admission of guilt.

## Myth 3: "Traffic School Erases the Ticket Completely"

**Fact:** Traffic school typically prevents points from being added to your license, but the ticket still exists on your record.

## Myth 4: "You Don't Need to Show Up in Court"

**Fact:** Always check your ticket for court appearance requirements. Some violations require mandatory court appearances.

## Myth 5: "Tickets Don't Affect Insurance"

**Fact:** Traffic violations can significantly impact your insurance rates, sometimes for up to three years.
