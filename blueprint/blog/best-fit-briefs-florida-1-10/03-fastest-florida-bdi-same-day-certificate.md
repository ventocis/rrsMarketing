# Which Florida BDI is fastest to finish online (same‑day certificate)?

Always check your **clerk’s rules** and use the **FLHSMV Traffic School Completion Check** to verify.

## What to do next
- Choose an **FLHSMV‑approved** online BDI and complete it as soon as possible.
- **Download/save** your certificate and follow your **clerk’s submission** steps.
- **Verify completion** via FLHSMV’s Traffic School Completion Check.
