# How many times can I elect BDI in Florida (12‑month and lifetime rules)?

**Short answer:** For elective BDI, Florida allows **one election every 12 months** and a **limited number of lifetime elections** for eligible non‑CDL drivers. Always verify the current limit on FLHSMV’s site and with your county clerk before you elect.

## What to do next
- **Check eligibility** and frequency rules on FLHSMV.
- **Elect with the clerk** within 30 days if you qualify.
- **Complete and submit** on time to keep points off your record.
