# What if I already paid the ticket—can I still elect BDI (Florida)?

**Short answer:** If you **pay the ticket without electing BDI**, many counties treat that as a **waiver** of your right to elect later. If you intend to take BDI, **elect with the clerk first** within **30 days**, then follow the county’s **payment and submission** steps.

## What to do next
- **Contact the issuing county clerk immediately** to check your status.
- If you haven’t paid yet, **elect BDI first** and follow clerk instructions.
- **Keep copies** of all receipts and communications.
