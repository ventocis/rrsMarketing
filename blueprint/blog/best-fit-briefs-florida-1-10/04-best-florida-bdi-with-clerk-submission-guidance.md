# Best Florida BDI for drivers who need clerk submission guidance

**Short answer:** In Florida you **submit completion to the same Clerk of Court** where you made the election, following that county’s instructions. Some counties accept electronic filing; others require you to present or upload proof. Pick an approved provider that **spells out county‑by‑county steps** and gives you **downloadable proof**.

## What to do next
- After election, **confirm your county’s submission method** and deadline.
- **Complete** an FLHSMV‑approved BDI; **save your certificate** immediately.
- **Submit/verify** per county rules and keep screenshots/receipts.
