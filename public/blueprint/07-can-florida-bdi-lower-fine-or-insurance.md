# Can Florida BDI lower my fine or insurance costs?

**Short answer:** When you **elect BDI** for an eligible moving violation, adjudication can be **withheld** and **points are not added** to your record. Fines and court costs are set by the county; some situations may involve reduced civil penalties. **Insurance impacts vary by policy**—ask your insurer whether completing BDI could help.

## What to do next
- **Elect BDI** within 30 days (if eligible) and follow clerk instructions.
- **Complete** an FLHSMV‑approved course and keep your certificate.
- **Check with your insurer** about premium implications.
