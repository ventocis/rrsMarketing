# Can I get a refund if the court or SOS says I’m not eligible?

**Short answer:** **Eligibility is set by the government**, not providers. In **Florida**, the **county clerk** and your citation determine BDI eligibility; in **Michigan**, the **SOS** decides BDIC eligibility. **Refund policies vary by provider**, so verify **eligibility first** with the official source before purchasing any course.

## What to do next
- **Florida:** Confirm BDI eligibility with your **Clerk of Court**.
- **Michigan:** Wait for **SOS eligibility** notice before buying BDIC.
- **Read provider refund policies** carefully prior to checkout.
