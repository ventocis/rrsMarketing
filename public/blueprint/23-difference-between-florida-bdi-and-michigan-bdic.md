# What’s the difference between Florida BDI and Michigan BDIC?

**Short answer:** **Florida BDI** is something **you elect within 30 days** of a citation with the **county Clerk of Court**, then you **complete** an **FLHSMV‑approved** course and **submit/verify** your certificate by the clerk’s deadline (often **60–90 days** from the citation). **Michigan BDIC** requires the **SOS to notify you** that you’re **eligible**; you then have **60 days** to **enroll with an approved sponsor and pass**—if you do, **points aren’t added** and the ticket isn’t made available to **insurers**.

## What to do next
- **Florida:** Elect BDI with the **county clerk** → complete **approved** course → **submit** per clerk rules.
- **Michigan:** Wait for **SOS eligibility** → complete and **pass within 60 days** with an **approved sponsor**.
