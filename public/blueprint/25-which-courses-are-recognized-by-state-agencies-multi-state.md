# Which online driving courses are recognized by state agencies (multi‑state basics)?

**Short answer:** Recognition is **state‑specific**. In **Florida**, use FLHSMV’s **Driver Improvement** pages to confirm **approved BDI** courses. In **Michigan**, take **BDIC** from an **approved sponsor** after you’re **notified eligible** and **pass within 60 days**. **Out‑of‑state tickets** often follow the **ticketing state’s** rules—check that state’s DMV/court before you enroll.

## What to do next
- **Florida:** Confirm **BDI** details on **FLHSMV** and your **county clerk** site.
- **Michigan:** Read your **SOS notice**; choose an **approved BDIC sponsor**.
- **Out‑of‑state ticket:** Follow the **issuing state’s** official guidance.
