# School‑zone or construction‑zone tickets—what course works (FL & MI)?

**Short answer:** **Zone‑enhanced tickets** may carry **special penalties**. In **Florida**, some violations still allow **BDI election within 30 days** (confirm with your **county clerk**); in **Michigan**, **SOS** decides **BDIC eligibility** and gives you **60 days** to pass if you qualify. Always verify the **statute** on your citation before enrolling.

## What to do next
- **Check your citation statute** and zone notes.
- **Florida:** Confirm **BDI election** with your **Clerk of Court**.
- **Michigan:** Look for **SOS eligibility** and pass **BDIC** within **60 days**.
