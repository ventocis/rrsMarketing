# What’s the easiest Michigan BDIC course to pass in 60 days?

**Short answer:** If you’re **eligible**, the Michigan Department of State (SOS) will **notify you** and you’ll have **60 days** to **enroll, complete, and pass** a **Basic Driver Improvement Course (BDIC)** with an **approved sponsor**. Choose an online provider with clear progress tracking and mobile access so you can finish comfortably within the window. You can **enroll multiple times** within 60 days, but you can **only pass once** under the program.

## What to do next

- **Pick an approved sponsor** and plan time to complete the course early.
- **Save your receipt** and keep personal records of completion.
