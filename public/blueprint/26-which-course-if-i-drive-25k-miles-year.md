# Which course should I choose if I drive 25k miles/year (risk & insurance)?

**Short answer:** If you’re ticketed in **Florida**, **elect BDI within 30 days** to **withhold points** (and follow your **clerk’s** certificate rules). In **Michigan**, if **SOS says you’re eligible**, completing **BDIC within 60 days** keeps **points off** and **insurers** from seeing the ticket. For **insurance‑only** savings, ask your insurer which **approved** courses they accept.

## What to do next
- **Florida:** Elect **BDI** with your **clerk**; complete and **submit** on time.
- **Michigan:** If **eligible**, pass **BDIC** with an **approved sponsor** within **60 days**.
- **Insurance:** Verify **discount eligibility** with your insurer before purchasing.
